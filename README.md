#ðŸ“ŠProject Overview :
Python libraries used in this project:
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
 MY Steps and Questions:
DATA CLEANING STEP:
1. Handling missing values ('if there!')
2. Handling the incorrect data types ('if there !)
ANALYSIS STEP:
1. showing the statistical description for the data
2. visualize the distribution of requests across different hours of the day and further differentiate them based on the pickup point(Airport or City )
3.how many requests were made on each day ?
4.divide the time of the day into four categories(morning_rush ,evening_rush , day_time, late_night ,pre_morning) 
5.Identify the hours with highest number of requests
6. visualize the number of requests in different time slots and their corresponding statuses(Trip completed , cancelled ,No cars available) to identify the most critical problems
7.as the highest number of cancellations are in the "Morning Rush" time slot , i visualize the number of requests at the morning_rush in different pickup point and their corresponding statuses
8.as the highest number of No cars available are in the "evening Rush" time slot ,i visualize the number of requests at the evening_rush in different pickup point and their corresponding statuses
9.how many trip completed at evening rush in the Airport
10.how many cancelled trips from the airport during the evening rush.
11.how many no cars available from the airport during the evening rush.
12.how many trip completed at evening rush in the City
13.how many requests in the evening rush hour in the city
14.how many trip completed at morning rush in the City
15.how many cancelled trips from the City during the morning rush.
16.how many no cars available from the City during the morning rush.

CONCLUSION :
. number of cancelled trips in city is high at morning rush
.There are not enough cars in the Airport at evening rush
.6:00 pm is the highest time for requests at the Airport
.5:00 am is the highest time for requests at the City
